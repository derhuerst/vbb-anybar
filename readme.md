## Installing

```shell
npm install -g vbb-anybar
```


## Usage

*This guide assumes you have the [AnyBar app](https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar#anybar-os-x-menubar-status-indicator) installed.*

`vbb-anybar` needs the station where you want to catch the train and the direction, which is just the next station your train will pass. You can find them using [`vbb-stations-cli`](https://github.com/derhuerst/vbb-stations-cli#vbb-stations-cli). To set them, run the following:

```shell
vbb-anybar init <station-id> <next-station-id> [<time-to-station>]
```

From now on, if you call `vbb-anybar` (without any arguments), it will talk to the AnyBar app and set a color that tells you when to leave. You would usually run this every few seconds.

time-to-station is an optional argument which allows you to configure a time (in minutes) for how long it takes you to get to the station. The color telling you when to leave will calculate with this time as well.


## API

```
Usage:
    vbb-anybar
    vbb-anybar init <station-id> <next-station-id> [<time-to-station>]
```
